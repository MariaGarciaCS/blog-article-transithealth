### How was Chicago, a city with nearly 3 million people and one of the best public transportation systems in the country, impacted by covid-19?

Chicago is America’s 3rd largest city, and it is often recognized for its public transportation system. A person in the suburbs can easily find a CTA train stop and take a 30 minute trip to the loop where they would be met with varying options such as rentable bikes, public buses,  rideshare and taxi services. 

So how did this city’s transportation system hold up against a global pandemic? Were neighborhoods impacted disproportionately? And how has transportation in the city changed over time? Lucky, [TransitHealth](https://scarletstudio.github.io/transithealth/) by [Scarlet Data Studio](https://scarletstudio.github.io/) can help answer some of these questions. 

Transit Health is a web application that gathers and displays data sets from the [Chicago Health Atlas](https://chicagohealthatlas.org/) and the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) that help us understand the relationships between transportation, Chicago and the impact of covid. I had the pleasure of working as a software engineer intern on Transit Health and looking at how the transportation accessibility was affected for people with disabilities.
